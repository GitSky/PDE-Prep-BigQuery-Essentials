# First Query
# Create a query that produces the average trip time for trips originating from the airport in Frankfurt, Germany (FRA)
# and destined for the airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KUL), and group the results by airline.
# The resulting average times should be similar

SELECT AVG(MINUTES) FROM JasmineJasper.triplog WHERE ORIGIN="FRA" AND DESTINATION="KUL" GROUP BY AIRLINE


# Second Query
# Create a query that produces the average trip time for trips originating from London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom (LHR)
# and destined for the airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (KUL), and group the results by airline, and order them from lowest to highest.
# The resulting average times should reveal whether the airline, PlanePeople Air, kept its promise to use faster airplanes from Heathrow Airport.

SELECT AIRLINE,AVG(MINUTES) FROM JasmineJasper.triplog WHERE ORIGIN="LHR" AND DESTINATION="KUL" GROUP BY AIRLINE ORDER BY AVG(MINUTES) ASC
